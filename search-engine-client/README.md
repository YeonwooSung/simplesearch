# Search Engine Client

This is the client side application for my second attempt at a search engine. It works like [google.com](https://google.com/) and allows the user to make requests to the engine's API.

## Installation
- Clone the repository
- `yarn`
- `yarn start`

This runs in conjunction with the other two microservices:
- [Crawler](../search-engine-crawler/)
- [API](../search-engine-api/)
